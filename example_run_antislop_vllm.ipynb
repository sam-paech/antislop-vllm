      "Writing prompt: Thanks to some clever dealings, he now had the cock of an incubus. Huge size, always perfect fit, and it's now literally impossible for him to not make any partner\n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Thanks to some clever dealings, he now had the cock of an incubus. It was a gift, really, given to him by an old associate of his, a being who dabbled in things far beyond the reach of mortal hands. He wasn't sure exactly how the deal had gone down. He remembered a meeting in the darkened back room of an old club, a cryptic exchange of some rare items he didn’t understand, and then a whisper in a voice that didn't sound quite like a voice at all. It had been easy, he told himself. Nothing more than a risk worth taking. Now, he had something truly unique, and he didn't know whether it was a curse, a gift, or something in between. It was, above all, useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a man of few words, with a well-built frame, sharp features, and a way about him that had always drawn the opposite sex in. His charm was genuine, his wit razor-sharp, and now, thanks to this new gift, he had something that made him irresistible in a way that was far beyond normal human appeal. The cock he now possessed was not just larger than anything he had known, but also far more potent. He found that not only was it perfectly suited to any and every woman, but it carried an effect that no man ever had: the ability to make a woman cum simply by engaging with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there was more to it. It wasn't just the sexual prowess that made his relationships unique—it was the certainty that any woman he slept with would become pregnant.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found this out rather quickly. The woman he was with at the time, an art dealer named Lila, had been on the pill, but her period never came. She was shocked, and rather than being angry, she was intrigued. \"This must be some kind of supernatural thing,\" she said. \"You have a gift.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It turned out that his new anatomy made it impossible to avoid impregnation. Every time he had sex, whether with a woman or a man, the chance of conception was 100%. He tried everything to avoid it, from using protection to skipping intimacy. But somehow, no matter what, they always ended up getting pregnant. And the women didn't seem to mind at all. In fact, they seemed thrilled. It was like the gift of his cock had brought with it a kind of magical fertility that was both welcomed and expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, he was concerned about the implications. What if he slept with someone who wasn’t ready for a child? What if he accidentally created an entire family of children who would be burdened with this unnatural inheritance? But it turned out that the women never seemed to mind. They were eager, and even the ones who were not in a serious relationship seemed to fall in love with him quickly. It was like having a superpower that made you a lover, a father, and a symbol of fertility all in one.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t long before he found himself in the spotlight. Women came to him from all over, seeking intimacy. The local newspapers were already picking up on it—stories about a mysterious man with an uncanny ability to make women climax and get pregnant. People didn’t seem to care about the strange details. They cared about the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, he became known as \"The Incubus,\" a title that both intrigued and terrified people. Some came to him in secret, hoping for a glimpse of the mystical power that made him so desirable. Others came with a mix of curiosity and fear, trying to see if the rumors were true. But the more women he helped in this way, the more he realized that it was not just about the sexual act. There was a deeper emotional connection being made through this unique gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "He became a kind of modern-day savior, a man who gave women not just pleasure, but the chance to be mothers. He had the power to make women feel desired, to make them feel powerful, and to give them the gift of motherhood in a time when many were struggling with infertility. It was as though the world needed him, and he needed them in return.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started to see his gift as a calling. Not just to seduce, but to help. He partnered with charities, donating his time and energy to help women who were struggling with infertility. He became a symbol of hope, a man who was able to give what others could not. He wasn't just making women cum—he was giving them a chance at life, a chance to grow and raise children, and to be part of something bigger.\n",
      "\n",
      "His life changed rapidly. He moved out of the city, bought a large estate in the countryside, and set up a kind of sanctuary for women who needed help. He didn't charge for his services, nor did he ask for anything in return. He simply wanted to help people. It was an act of compassion that came from his new understanding of his power.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were challenges, of course. Some of the women were not ready for the responsibility of motherhood, and it was hard to convince them that they could handle it. Some were scared, others angry, and others simply didn’t want to be pregnant. He understood their fears and respected them, but ultimately, the women who sought him out were the ones who were ready for change.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he grew older, he started to wonder about the long-term effects of his new power. Would the children born from his seed inherit any of the incubus traits? Would they be fertile, or would they be cursed like him? He had a few children, and they were healthy—strong, intelligent, and, for the most part, normal. But as they grew, he watched their sexual development, always waiting for something to change. When it didn’t, he felt both relief and confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It turned out that his incubus heritage didn’t pass to his offspring. They were merely humans who had been given the chance to be born through a man who had touched the supernatural. They were not incubi, they were simply children born to a man who had once made a deal with something otherworldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, his life was never the same. He was no longer just a man. He was a symbol, a legend, a savior of the modern age. And for all his power, he never looked back. He had the gift of an incubus. He used it. He gave it away. And he lived the rest of his life with the satisfaction of knowing that he had given the world something extraordinary.<|im_end|>\n",

      "In a world where people must have weekly sex to survive, the human race has been forever changed. The original cause of this new necessity was never quite understood—some claimed it was a virus, others thought it was an experiment gone wrong. Whatever it was, the truth was that every human being now requires sexual activity on a weekly basis in order to stay alive. The effects were immediate and dramatic. The world's population was thrown into chaos. Cities were abandoned, families broke apart, and the psychological and emotional toll on individuals was immense.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the aftermath, a new profession emerged to help people navigate this new reality: the Emergency Sex Workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am one of them. Not by choice, but by necessity. I didn’t become a sex worker to be a prostitute. I became one to keep people alive. I work for the Emergency Sexual Services Department, a government agency established after the change. There are laws now, like there used to be for doctors and fire fighters, and I'm one of them—licensed, tested, insured.\n",
      "\n",
      "My job is to provide safe, legal, and monitored sexual interactions for anyone in the city who hasn’t had one this past week. You can’t go to your partner, or your spouse, or your significant other. You might not be able to see them, you might not even be able to remember them. So, people come to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're called ESWs—Emergency Sex Workers. I work the night shift, from 10 PM to 4 AM, at the City Sexual Services Center, or what is known in casual talk as the \"Slick Box.\" It’s not a building, technically, but more of a network of temporary centers that open and close as needed. I sometimes travel from one to the other depending on the demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each client needs a session. You get a few minutes of attention, a few minutes of skin contact, a few minutes of release. It's not about pleasure, not really. It's about survival. The sexual act is a catalyst for a chemical reaction in the brain and body that keeps the heart pumping and the lungs breathing. It's not just an emotional or psychological thing—it’s biological.\n",
      "\n",
      "I work with a variety of people. I have the elderly who’ve been forgotten, the lonely, the sick, the addicts. Sometimes I see people who’ve been alone for weeks, not knowing how to touch another human being. It's sad, but it's part of the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "My co-workers and I are trained not only to perform the sexual act but also to provide emotional support and reassurance. We are not just here to have sex with strangers—we are here to be with them, to help them feel less alone, less broken. I tell my clients that this is not about them, that I'm not judging them. I do this to help, and not because I want to be here. Sometimes that's hard for them to believe. But it is the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember a particular client, a middle-aged man named Tony, who came in early one evening. His wife had passed away two months prior, and the stress and isolation had taken its toll. He looked tired, and when I first met him, he said nothing. I just sat with him, held his hand, and eventually we had our session. He cried through most of it. It was the worst and best session I had in a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "People don't just come for the physical contact. They come for the connection, the reminder that they are not alone, that someone is still with them, even if it's only for a few minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rules are strict. Everyone is tested before they come in, and every session is recorded and monitored. You don't get more than a minute or two of intimacy, and you don't get to choose your partner. You get a random match, and that’s that. There are some people who try to be picky, or who are resistant, but in the end, they all need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve had people who have tried to seduce me, to make it more than it is, to turn me into something else. I've had people who have yelled and screamed and cried, who have cursed and thanked me, who have wept with joy and with sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are people who come in expecting a lover, who come in expecting someone to care about them. But I can't be that for all of them. I’m not here to fall in love with my clients. I'm here to provide a service, and it's a service that is necessary, not sentimental.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people look down on my job, even within the emergency services sector. They see me as a lower-level worker, a provider of a service that is not as respected as other professions. They don’t see that I hold the lives of many in my hands, that I can be the only thing standing between someone and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve seen people who couldn’t get through a session and have died on the table, their bodies still warm, their skin still flushed, their hearts still beating in the last few seconds of their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I carry that with me every day. I carry the weight of those who depended on me, those who had no one else. I carry the weight of the people who looked into my eyes, saw not a prostitute, but a person, and left the clinic feeling a little more alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world is not perfect. The government does not control everything. There are still people who try to avoid the rules, to avoid the necessary contact, to avoid the system. There are still people who would rather die than go through the process. But there’s more of us now than ever before, and there are more of us trained than ever before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I'm not the kind of person people dream of being. I’m not a hero. I’m not a savior. I’m just a worker, doing a job that doesn’t look good on a resume.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m also the person that helps people survive. I give them a moment of connection. I give them a moment of warmth. I give them a moment to feel alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in this world, that moment might be the only thing that keeps them going.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I do what I must. I have sex with strangers. I give people what they need. I give them more than just the physical act. I give them a connection, even if it is temporary.\n",

      "\n",
      "She had no name now. The town just called her “the Cursed Freeuse Slut.” That was all they needed. That was all they saw. People didn’t remember her name anymore — not the same name, anyway. She had lived her life once with a name, with a face, with a family, but that had been before the witch’s touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "It started with a simple desire. She had been a lonely woman, a woman who had never truly been loved. She wanted love, wanted connection, wanted to be wanted. But in her search, she had come upon an old witch who sold power. Power to be loved — but only if she could be given up to love itself, without will or thought. So she bargained and bartered, and in return, the witch cursed her. And that curse would be her punishment and her blessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been blessed with a body so alluring — so perfect — that every man who laid eyes upon her fell in love, or at the very least, completely overwhelmed. The witch had done her work well: men could not resist and would fuck her on sight without thought. Her body had become a curse and a miracle, a curse that turned her into the town’s freeuse slut — not for her will, but for her body’s irresistible pull.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, the curse had been terrifying. Her body was a prison, and the men of the town were the keys. Every step she took, every time she passed a window, a man would be stopped in his tracks, his attention drawn, his body moving with a primal urgency. She tried to stay indoors. She tried to keep her head down. But no amount of caution could stop what she had become.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she was used. Used in every way. Used in the fields, in the barns, on the docks, in the back rooms of saloons and hotels. Men didn’t ask her permission. They didn’t even ask her name. She was just another object, another body, another thing to use. The curse had been given, and the witch had ensured that the town knew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was no longer in control of her own life. Her body was the object of every man's desire, and they all had a need to satisfy. She was taken when she walked to the market. She was taken when she walked through town. She was taken even when she was just walking in the woods. She had no choice. She had no escape. She had no privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, she tried to resist. She would scream, she would try to fight, she would run, but it was all for nothing. The men would stop, and their hands would go to their pants, their eyes would glaze over, and before she could say a word, they were upon her. It was as if she had no will, and they had no control.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after the first few months, she stopped fighting. She had tried everything and found nothing that worked. And so, she surrendered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she walked into the store with a bag slung over her shoulder and a smile on her face. The men in the store didn't even try to hide their lust. They just looked at her, and their minds were taken over. She was used in every corner of the store. She was used on the shelves. She was used in the aisles. She was used behind the counter. She was used in every way, by every man in the store, until she was so completely worn out that she could barely stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The store became her favorite place. She would come every day, and she would be used. She would be used in the back room, in the kitchen, in the garage. She would be used and then passed on to the next man, and the next, and the next. She had no choice but to be used. And she would not be used by one man alone — they would all take her, one after another, in a frenzy of passion and desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would be gangbanged to sleep in the back of the store. She would be surrounded by men, and she would be taken from all angles, all positions, all ways of love. She didn’t even feel the pain anymore. She had been stripped of her self, and she had become just a body. A body of flesh and desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The men had names now, but she didn’t know them. She didn’t care. She had lost her sense of self, her sense of identity, and all that was left was the use of her body. And she was used. Used and used again, until she couldn’t remember what it meant to be herself. She had no thoughts of her own anymore, no will. Only the need to be used, to be taken, to be consumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The townspeople had made her a legend. They had made her a cautionary tale, but also a symbol of their own desires. She was known not for her name, but for her curse. She was the freeuse slut, the cursed woman who could not resist the pull of every man. She was not seen as a woman — she was seen as an object, a thing to be used, a body to be taken without consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, she was not a victim in the eyes of the town. She was not a woman who had been betrayed — she was the woman who had asked for this. The woman who had bargained with the witch for the power of love, and in turn, had accepted the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had given up her autonomy, her identity, her self. She had become the object of the town's desires, the thing that men would look at and just *have* to take. And she had accepted it, because she had chosen it. Or had she? She couldn’t remember, she couldn’t recall the time before she had been used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, she simply walked through town with a bag, and the men would follow, would stop, would look at her, and then she would be used. She would be taken, again and again. She had no name now, but she had a role. She was the cursed freeuse slut, and the town loved it. The town loved her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had no choice. She had no will. She had no thoughts of her own. Only the will of the men, the will of the town, and the will of the witch. She was a body, an object, a woman who had been cursed, and a woman who had accepted it.\n",
      "\n",

      "Write 1000 words to this prompt. Your response:\n",
      "\n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "On one hand, it's a really good DPS boost. On the other...\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the refrain that echoes across a wide range of communities, be it in gaming, work, technology, or even in personal relationships. It's a phrase that can be used with equal parts optimism and concern—saying that while there's a clear benefit to be reaped, there's also a balancing factor that needs to be considered. The phrase captures the essence of duality, of choice, and of consequence, and when you step back and think about it, the notion of a \"good DPS boost\" is not just about increasing damage per second in the context of a game. It's about pushing forward, about pushing the limits, about progress in any domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In video games, the concept of DPS is clearly defined. It's a measurement of how much damage a character can do in a given period of time—effectively, the efficiency of their damage output. When a new weapon, talent, or ability is introduced that significantly improves DPS, it's a clear advantage. It gives the player an edge in battle, allows them to clear enemies more quickly, and in competitive games, often determines the difference between victory and loss. That is the \"on one hand\" part of the equation. However, on the other, such a boost may come at the cost of versatility, playstyle flexibility, or overall balance in the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a reason why game developers are hesitant about massive DPS increases. They can disrupt the equilibrium of the game's mechanics. If one class or build suddenly becomes unkillable due to an overpowered DPS boost, the overall player experience can suffer. The fun is taken out of the game if players feel like the game has become a single, unbalanced system. On the other hand, a good DPS boost is exactly what players seek. They want to feel strong, to feel like the game is fair and that their efforts are rewarded with visible progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "This duality can be seen in just about any field, not just gaming. In the workplace, for example, a new initiative or system that streamlines processes and increases productivity can be a real DPS boost. It makes things faster, more efficient, and allows the company to scale. That’s the good news. But on the other hand, such efficiency can come at the cost of employee well-being, morale, or the creativity that comes from more organic, less rigid processes. If a company is too focused on efficiency, it may lose the human touch that makes the company function as a community rather than a machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In technology, the phrase can be interpreted even more broadly. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation systems brings with them the potential for massive increases in productivity, efficiency, and speed—those are the DPS boosts. However, on the other hand, the widespread adoption of AI could lead to significant job displacement, privacy concerns, and a redefinition of what it means to be human in the workforce. As we move forward, it's important to ask not just if the technology improves DPS, but who benefits from that improvement, and what kind of trade-offs are involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Education is another field where this duality is present. A new teaching method, online learning platform, or a highly efficient curriculum might boost learning outcomes and efficiency—this is the DPS. But on the other hand, these tools may not provide the human interaction that is so crucial in learning. They may prioritize speed over depth, or efficiency over understanding. The question here isn’t just whether we can learn more efficiently, but whether we are actually learning in the way that is most beneficial to our long-term growth and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "In relationships, the concept can be seen more metaphorically. If one partner becomes more emotionally available or more committed, that's a form of \"DPS\" in the relationship—it improves the connection, makes the relationship stronger, and more fulfilling. However, on the other hand, it may come at the cost of personal space, autonomy, or the ability for both partners to grow as individuals. Relationships are complex and require a balance between togetherness and independence, and the idea of improving one part of the relationship can have unintended effects on the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Health and fitness is a sector where this concept is also extremely relevant. A new workout regime, a dietary supplement, or a piece of high-tech fitness equipment can all be a DPS boost—improving performance and health outcomes. But on the other hand, they may come with risks. Some workout regimes can lead to injury if not done carefully, and some supplements or equipment may have harmful side effects if used incorrectly or without guidance. It's the balance between the boost and the potential risk that makes the question so critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the world of finance, a new investment strategy or market trend might offer a significant increase in returns, which is the DPS. But on the other hand, it may carry high risk, and if not managed carefully, could lead to financial ruin. This is where the duality is most clearly expressed—how much return are you willing to risk for the chance of a better DPS, and what are the potential costs if things go wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "Environmental science is another arena where the idea of DPS is mirrored in the concept of ecological impact. A new industrial process, technology, or agricultural method might increase production or efficiency dramatically—this is the DPS. But on the other hand, it may come with a high cost to the environment, leading to long-term damage that outweighs the benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, whether it's a game, a job, a relationship, or a global issue, the concept of “DPS” is a metaphor for the idea of progress or efficiency. It's a way of measuring the effectiveness of something, and in many cases, it's a goal to be pursued. However, it's also a reminder that progress isn't always a straight line. It's not always without its trade-offs or its risks. It's the reminder that every gain comes with a potential cost, and that every \"boost\" in performance may need to be weighed against the possible negative consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when we hear the phrase, \"On one hand, it's a really good DPS boost. On the other...\" we should take it not as a simple statement, but as a call for deeper reflection. It's a sign that there's more to consider, that while something may offer a significant benefit, there's another side to the story. It's a prompt to think carefully, to be balanced, and to consider all the factors at play before making a decision, a change, or a move in the right direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any context, whether digital or real, the phrase is a reminder that progress must be tempered with prudence. It's about knowing when to push forward and when to hold back, when to take the boost and when to consider the balance of the game.<|im_end|>\n",

The house, sprawling and elegant, had a history that ran deep in the family, and Ethan was determined to honor it in the only way he could—by preserving the legacy of his uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first challenge came when he arrived at the mansion. A group of six maids—each with decades of experience and a deep sense of pride—greeted him warmly, though their eyes hinted at an unspoken sadness. Ethan, raised with strong moral values and a deep-seated belief in equality and dignity, felt an immediate sense of duty to the women who had served in the house for years.\n",

      "It wasn’t until a few days in, when the maids were making a special meal for him, that Ethan discovered a deeply disturbing truth. Through a combination of old letters and an overheard conversation, he learned that the maids were not only mistreated, but also forced into performing sexual services for his uncle. The information was a shock, and Ethan was horrified. He made a promise to himself on that night: he would ensure that these women were treated with the respect and dignity they had so long been denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took steps to change the household. He began with restructuring the entire system of labor and service. He hired a legal advisor to ensure the maids had proper contracts and rights. He invited in local professionals to teach the women about financial planning, legal protections, and even offered to support their dreams of leaving the house and starting new lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also removed the old rules and boundaries, making it clear that any sexual act would be completely unacceptable. He made it a point to spend time with them, not just as the new owner, but as a friend. He learned their stories, their names, and he listened when they felt vulnerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, the maids were grateful. They appreciated the new order, the sense of security, and the change in attitude. But as time went on, and Ethan’s new policy took shape, an unspoken tension began to build. The maids had been used to certain privileges—some of which came with a price. Now, those things were gone. The house was no longer a place where certain acts were tolerated, let alone encouraged.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, they tried to adjust. But soon, the frustration became evident. They had been conditioned to believe that their worth was tied to their ability to please. Ethan, in his blind idealism, had stripped them of that. The maids started to grow restless, both with the new rules and with the new man who had taken over the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ethan noticed the changes in their behavior. They were no longer the same warm, helpful women. They were sullen, distant, and increasingly resentful. He had not realized just how deep the conditioning had gone. The maids were not just workers—they had been shaped by years of a system that had made them believe their value was in service that was far beyond what a house could offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, Ethan found one of the maids, Clara, alone in the library. She was reading, but her posture was rigid, and her eyes were red with unshed tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ethan,” she said quietly, not looking up from her book, “do you know what it meant to be a maid in this house? I didn’t come here to be a servant. I came here to be more than that.”\n",

      "\n",
      "In the days that followed, Ethan made a new attempt at re-establishing trust, but the maids grew more withdrawn. They began to resent the new system, not just for what it had taken from them, but for what it had given them—uncertainty. They had been used to a kind of predictable, if not always fair, order. Now, there was confusion and ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the other maids, Marta, spoke up more directly. “We were used, Ethan. Not just in the way you think. We were told, again and again, that this was our purpose. We were told that this house was the only place where we would be treated with any kind of dignity. When we said no, we were punished. When we said yes, we were rewarded. That was our world.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The tension reached a breaking point one evening when a younger maid, Lila, came into Ethan’s room, asking for permission to go to town. Ethan, without thinking, asked what for, and she hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I need to find something,” she said. “Something I can’t get here anymore.”\n",
      "\n",

      "In the weeks that followed, Ethan tried to bridge the gap. He offered them a chance to go to the city, to start new lives, to get education, to get a job. But the maids, for all their gratitude, did not want to leave. They didn’t want to be free—they wanted to be used, and they wanted to be appreciated.\n",

      "Evelyn sat quietly, her eyes closed as the interface activated. A tingling sensation crept up from her temples, followed by a warm, almost electrical feeling that spread through her neural pathways. The first data started uploading.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt the rush of information—math formulas, literature references, historical facts—like a flood of knowledge pouring into her brain. She could already recall entire volumes of poetry, theorems, even complex chemical reactions. She was stunned, even in that first moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then... something changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flood began to become more chaotic. She felt herself processing something that didn’t match the structure of academic knowledge. It was erratic. It was emotional. And it was... dirty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, she found herself recalling images. Not of historical events or chemical structures, but of... other things. She realized that the machine had not filtered everything. It had only scanned what it was told to scan, and it had scanned everything on her computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "She hadn't realized that among her notes and textbooks—some of which had been downloaded in a rush for her students—were also some old personal files, a folder named “Personal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That folder had, by mistake, contained a collection of adult material that Evelyn had downloaded once in college. She had thought she deleted it. She had thought she hadn’t saved it in the last several years. And the machine had not been able to differentiate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evelyn’s internal state began to change, and she became confused. Her mind was racing with knowledge and with images, and her body reacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face turned red. Her heart raced. She didn't know what she was seeing. She thought she might be having a neurological emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shut it down. Shut it down,\" she muttered, but the machine was already halfway through its upload.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood up and pushed the machine away from her. But the neural interface had already made its impact. The information was already inside her, and some of it was now indelible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evelyn sat on the floor of her study, the machine still blinking with a green light, the scanner now idly repeating the final phase of its upload. She tried to breathe. She tried to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mind was a battlefield. She had just absorbed every known mathematical principle, every major historical event, every philosophical argument she could ever need. But now her mind was also filled with something she never intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought of the students. She had always told them to study hard, to read, to think. She had always told them that knowledge was power. But now, for the very few who would see it, she realized she had become something... more.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not just a teacher anymore. She was not just a scientist. She was now something different. A paradox. A mixture of brilliance and something else—something she had not yet named, but which was now in her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, Evelyn was in her classroom, preparing to lecture on Newtonian physics. But as she opened her mouth, the words came out differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "She noticed a student, a boy named Mike, who had never spoken to her before. He looked at her with some surprise, a strange combination of awe and confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you just say... something different?\" He asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him, caught off guard.\n",

      "\"Of course I said the same things. What's this about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mike shifted uncomfortably and glanced at his classmates. \"It's just... you're kind of different now. I don't know how to say it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked away, and Evelyn felt something strange in her mind. She had just read a very detailed and scientific explanation of how human perception works, and now she was beginning to question if it was truly her own voice, or if it was some influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her students began to notice. They began to look at her as if she had changed. She noticed a new kind of attention in their eyes. She had always been respected, of course, but now she was something more. Or something less. Something different.\n",
      "\n",
      "She decided to keep her mind clear, to not let the images that had been uploaded define her. But that was not possible. They were there. Always. Some she could suppress. Some she couldn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was still a teacher, still a scientist. But she also remembered things. Things she hadn't wanted to remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "She became more isolated. Her students asked her questions, but she sometimes answered differently. She would quote poetry she had never studied before, she would speak about the human experience with a new kind of clarity. But some of them thought she was becoming more cynical, more distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "She asked herself what she had become. Was she still Evelyn Langley, the scientist who had created this machine to improve knowledge? Or was she something more? Had she truly made herself perfect? Or had she just made herself… strange?\n",
      "\n",
      "She returned to the machine, the same one that had given her the power and the burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat before it again, and this time, she wasn't sure what she should do. She could try to delete the information from her brain. But that would take time, and it would not be safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at the machine. It was silent now, but it had made its impact. And now, she had to live with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evelyn Langley was no longer just a teacher. She was the product of her own ambition, of her own curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had created a machine to change the world, and now that world had changed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was no longer just a perfect student. She was no longer just a perfect teacher. She was the perfect paradox.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with that, she stood up and walked out of her study, her mind filled with the knowledge of the world and the memories of things she never wanted. She had created something that could never be undone. She had made herself into the very thing she feared.\n",

      "Writing prompt: The catgirls are way out of your price range, and mermaids at no fault of their own are expensive to maintain. What sort of monstergirls can\n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Living in the bustling city of New Tokyo, I’m a collage student, and with that title comes all the responsibilities and luxuries — or rather, the lack thereof. My budget is as tight as the seams on my second-hand hoodie, and the costs of maintaining an everyday life are enough to break most people. So when it comes to the question of monstergirl companionship — specifically the kind that includes magical beings, cute features, and, regrettably, staggering prices — I have to think in practical terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've always been a huge fan of monstergirl culture, especially since it's been trending in the media and on the internet. It's not just about the visual appeal, it's about the fantasy of living with someone who isn’t entirely human. However, the catgirls I see at the club are not something I can afford. Their upkeep? Beyond my grasp. Same with mermaids — magical creatures that require special water systems, unique diets, and the kind of living conditions you can only dream about having if you're a high-end entrepreneur.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I had to think of a solution that fits my budget and still gives me the magical monstergirl experience. What I can afford are the monstergirls that are not just magical, but also practical.\n",
      "\n",
      "First on the list would be the goblin girl. They're often seen in fantasy games as mischievous, short, and tough. But in reality, goblins are practical creatures who are hardy and can survive on almost anything. A goblin girl doesn't need a fancy environment; she can live on simple food, a small space, and minimal care. She can even be useful around the house, helping with small repairs and keeping track of things. And the best part? They’re usually quite friendly and independent — not requiring constant attention or expensive care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the halfling. Similar to goblins in some ways but with a more cheerful and homey disposition, halflings are known for being community-oriented and having a knack for gardening and small-scale farming. I live in a city, so growing my own food isn’t the most practical, but if I have a small apartment with a window or balcony, I can grow a few herbs and some easy vegetables. A halfling girl would be right at home, enjoying the greenery and contributing to the household with her cooking skills and gardening abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn’t be able to support a full-fledged orc girl, but a small, low-maintenance orc girl, or even an orclet — a younger, more manageable version — might be feasible. Orcs are known for their strength and endurance, and they're often seen as simple in their needs. If I found one with a gentle disposition, I might be able to have a companion who’s strong enough to help with chores and not too demanding. Plus, they can be a bit of an oddity that’s fun to live with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goblin girl and halfling both have another advantage: they’re often seen as more community-friendly and willing to participate in a more social aspect. This helps with something I was missing in my life: companionship. Living in the city, being alone with my textbooks and my laptop wasn't helping my mental state. A friendly goblin girl or halfling girl would be the kind of person who could keep me company, not just for their looks but also for their character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are the bug girls. From scorpions to centipedes, bug girls are a variety of creatures that don’t require a lot of space. A centipede girl, for instance, has long legs and could be interesting and unique. They can be independent, requiring very little attention, and maybe they can even help with small household tasks — like cleaning in hard-to-reach corners. Bug girls also have a reputation of being a bit mysterious and adventurous, and I think I'd enjoy exploring the city with one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found that the key to affordability is not just about price, but also about the type of creature. Some monstergirls, like the goblin and halfling, are not only cheaper to maintain but also have useful traits. They might even be able to help with chores or contribute to the household in ways that make living together more sustainable and budget-friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, I’m also a collage student, so I can’t have a very complicated life. I need a companion who is not going to require constant attention, a high-end diet, or a magical water system. That’s why the mermaid is out — and even the more exotic catgirl, despite being adorable and sometimes very approachable, is too far out of my budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s not all about the budget — it’s about the relationship. A goblin girl might not be the most high-maintenance in terms of care, but she might be the most high-maintenance in terms of personality. If she’s a mischievous goblin, I might have a lot to deal with — from lost things to chaotic behaviors. That could be a fun challenge, or it could be more stressful than I expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The halfling is better for that. She tends to be more even-tempered and sociable, which can make her easier to get along with. But not every halfling is the same — I would need to find one that’s compatible with my lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t even consider the more expensive, magical monstergirls. There are those like the elemental creatures — fire elementals, ice elementals, water elementals — but those require a special kind of living space and care. Plus, their magical energy needs to be maintained, and I don't have the resources for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I need is a friend — not just one who looks great or is magical, but one who can be a good companion in every sense. A person who I can have conversations with, share meals with, and perhaps even have a small adventure with from time to time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the goblin girl, the halfling girl, and even the bug girl all have their own appeal. They’re not the most glamorous or the most magical, but they’re real, and I can afford them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found that being a collage student on a budget doesn't mean I can't have fun or companionship. It just means that I have to be smart about what I choose. And while the catgirls and mermaids might be out of my budget, I can still find a magical companion who fits into my world, not one that takes over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My next step is to look for these types of monstergirls in the city. Whether it be at a local monstergirl social event, in a community forum, or at a friend's apartment, I'm open to anything that can bring me a little more joy and company.\n",
      "\n",
      "And who knows — maybe, after I've found the right one, I can save up enough to bring on the more expensive ones later. But for now, the goblin, the halfling, and the bug girl — they’re more than enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "So while the magical world is out of reach financially, I’ve found a way to bring some of the magic into my life in a practical and affordable way. A way that makes my life a little more interesting, a little more colorful, and a little less lonely.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for now, that's more than enough.<|im_end|>\n",

      "Write 1000 words to this prompt. Your response\n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Have you ever posted something you're proud of, only to have it completely ignored—no comments, no upvotes, not even a single \"thanks for sharing\"? You pour your soul into your writing, your passion for a topic is palpable, and yet, it’s as if you didn’t even exist. That feeling of being unseen, of being ignored, can be soul-crushing. But when that happens within the context of the kink community—specifically when your writing explores elements of your kink and ends up getting downvoted or not responded to at all—it can lead to a uniquely devastating and complex emotion: kinkshaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kinkshaming is the act of shaming someone for engaging in, discussing, or expressing their kink. It often takes the form of a moral or social judgment, typically from people who don’t understand, accept, or support kink culture or behavior. It can be subtle, like the unspoken looks or the silence that surrounds what could be a vulnerable and honest sharing of one's desires and identity. And for many kinksters, one of the most hurtful forms of kinkshaming is the lack of response from peers, and the occasional downvoting or ignoring of their prompts or stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve posted a piece of writing on a kink-related forum or social media and then got zero response, it may have done something more than just hurt your feelings—it could have triggered deep insecurities, shame, and internalized stigma around your own kink and identity. It’s not uncommon for people to feel isolated in their kink preferences, and the silence or disapproval from others only amplifies that feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s be honest: being judged or misunderstood can be exhausting, but in the kink community, the judgment isn’t just verbal or visible. It can be silent. It can be a lack of response. And sometimes, that silence is louder than any harsh words.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you share something that’s deeply personal, like a story or a prompt that reflects your kink or your preferences, it's inherently vulnerable. You are opening up, and that can be terrifying. You’re not just sharing your thoughts or your fantasies—you're sharing a part of yourself that you may not feel comfortable sharing with even your closest friends. And the response you get from others can tell you so much about how safe you feel in this space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now imagine that no one responds. No one likes. No one comments. No one even reacts. It's not just the absence of affirmation, but a deep, almost oppressive silence. And in the kink world, silence can be misinterpreted as disapproval or judgment. That silence can feel like a condemnation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some, this experience isn't just a one-off. It can be a recurring theme in their online interactions within kink spaces. Over time, the pattern can lead to a kind of internalized kinkshaming, where the individual begins to believe that their kink is wrong, or not worthy of discussion, or not acceptable. This is the danger of online anonymity. It's easy for people to be cruel, judgmental, or simply indifferent behind the screen. And when you're already feeling vulnerable or different, that silence and disapproval can feel like confirmation that you don’t belong.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s an undeniable power in being able to express your kink and share your kink experiences. For many people, that’s a deeply transformative and healing act. It's not just about sex; it’s about identity, about autonomy, about self-acceptance and self-liberation. When that expression is met with silence, it can feel like a rejection of that identity. It can feel like being told, implicitly, that your kink isn't valid, or that it's not worth acknowledging.\n",

      "Some people might feel that they’re being “outed” or judged even before they've said a word. It's not unusual for kinksters to worry that their kink might make people uncomfortable or turn people off. So when they are met with a lack of response or even downvoting, they may internalize that as proof that what they are sharing is somehow wrong or not wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the thing: your kink is not a mistake. It’s not wrong. It’s not something to be ashamed of. Kink is simply a part of the vast human experience. Just like love, curiosity, desire, or even fear, kink is an expression of the human condition. It’s not something to be shamed, but something to be explored, accepted, and understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the experience of kinkshaming—whether it's in the form of direct criticism, judgment, or the simple absence of response—can be deeply hurtful and can take a toll on one’s self-esteem and sense of belonging.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you're writing or creating in a kink space and receive no feedback, it can be easy to misinterpret that as disapproval. It can feel like the world isn’t interested in what you have to say. It can feel like the world is telling you that your kink is not interesting, not worth sharing, or not worth acknowledging.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the truth is that silence doesn't always mean disapproval. Sometimes, people are simply too busy, or too distracted, or not the right person for that particular post. Not everyone engages in every conversation, especially not in every forum or social media platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the emotional impact of being ignored or downvoted in a place where you hope to be understood can be enormous. It’s a reminder of how vulnerable we are in sharing our deepest selves and how easily that vulnerability can be met with indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to recognize that kinkshaming is a form of discrimination. It's the kind of judgment that comes from not understanding or not accepting a person’s identity, preferences, or desires. It can be subtle or overt, and it can manifest in so many different ways—from the lack of engagement on a post to outright criticism and condemnation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just because some people shame others doesn’t mean that you should shame yourself. Your kink is not something that should make you feel ashamed. In fact, it's a part of who you are, and it can be a source of strength, understanding, and connection. It can also be a way to explore yourself more deeply and to connect with others in ways that are meaningful and affirming.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when you post something about your kink and get no response, don’t let it make you feel alone or ashamed. It’s not a reflection of your worth or your identity. It’s a reflection of the people who are choosing not to engage with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the most supportive and affirming kink communities are those that celebrate, respect, and engage with the diverse range of kink experiences. Those are the communities that validate and uplift you when you're vulnerable and honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the next time you're writing something that feels personal, vulnerable, or even a little raw, don't be afraid to put it out there. And if you get a response, whether it's positive or negative, don't let it define your worth. Because your kink is valid, it's real, and it's a part of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you ever feel kinkshamed, especially when you're simply sharing something honest and real about your identity, know that you're not alone. Many people have felt that same silence, that same downvoting, that same judgment. But none of that makes your kink wrong. In fact, it makes your vulnerability all the more powerful and significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "So keep sharing, keep exploring, keep being honest. Because your voice matters. Your identity matters. And your kink matters.<|im_end|>\n",

      "It started with a whisper — a faint, curious sound that led her through the dusty shelves of his childhood bedroom. She had gone there with the intention of borrowing his old video game console, but instead, she found herself standing in front of the largest bookshelf in the room — one that stretched almost to the ceiling. Behind it, and tucked away in the corner, was a closed and dusty cardboard box, the kind people use for storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "That box — it held more than just old toys and baseball cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "She didn’t intend to open it, but curiosity led the way. Her fingers were sticky from the soda can she had just finished and she had an itch in the back of her mind that said “this is important.” With a soft thump, the lid fell open and the first thing to hit her was the scent — the musk of years, a smell that made her think of late nights and secret things.\n",
      "\n",
      "She didn't expect to find the collection. She didn’t know what to call it. It was a drawer full of things she had known for years, but never confronted head-on. DVDs and CDs, neatly labeled and cataloged in plastic sleeves with neat, hand-written notes. Her name in bold letters on nearly every box. “My type,” he had written on one box, and it stopped her cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat there for a minute, her chest tight and her heart pounding. How many times had she thought of him, the one who used to come over all the time when she was a kid — the one who used to make her laugh, who used to tease her, who used to be everything to her in that golden age of childhood and young girl dreams?\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at her reflection in the mirror on his bedroom wall, and all of a sudden, it hit her — she was still a girl, and he had once thought of her as his type. Back when she was a kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at her body, her curves, her confidence, and suddenly, all the memories that had been stored in the corner of her mind flooded in. Her childhood was not so long ago. He had been her friend, her playmate, someone she had trusted with the secrets of her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, she thought, all those years of not being enough had been erased. He had thought of her all this time. He had wanted her.\n",
      "\n",
      "That revelation, more than anything, made her feel something she hadn’t felt in a very, very long time. It made her feel powerful, wanted, and perhaps, ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "She closed the box with a soft click and turned to walk back out of the room, but something stopped her. The thought, the idea — it was there, whispering in her ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not,” she thought. “Why not catch up on all the sex we could have had?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She hadn’t known if she even wanted to say that out loud, but when she did — to herself, in the quiet, almost empty room — the words rang louder and clearer than she expected. She didn't know if she was joking, but she didn't think she was. It wasn't like she had never had sex before — in fact, she was quite experienced. But it had always been about control and power and games, and in that moment, she wanted something different — something real, something with someone who had once been her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought about the way he used to look at her when she was younger, the way his eyes would light up when she walked in the room, the way he would tease her about how “mature” she was even when he had just turned 13.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, of course, the collection itself. She looked at it again, and it made her laugh. She had always known that he thought she was cute when she was a kid, but now she was seeing the proof of that thought — the proof that he had once thought of her not just as a friend, but as a potential love interest — someone he wanted to have sex with.\n",

      "“I mean, I used to be his type,” she said, the words coming out a little awkwardly. “I used to be cute. And now I’m not just cute — I’m hot. And maybe I always was. Maybe I just didn’t realize it.”\n",
      "\n",
